{"id":"vibedj-ac0","title":"SubSonic Connection Test Button Enable Fix","description":"The SubSonic settings have a button that allows the user to test the connection to the SubSonic server. Currently, the \"Test Connection\" button is only enabled if the password field has user-typed content. However, when a password is already stored in settings (displayed as stars), the button remains disabled even though valid credentials exist. This is a bug.","design":"- Keep the current behavior where the password field shows stars if a password is stored in settings.\n- The \"Test Connection\" button should be enabled if:\n  - The password field has user-typed content, OR\n  - A password is already stored in the settings\n- When testing the connection:\n  - Use the newly typed password if the user has entered one (takes precedence)\n  - Otherwise, use the password stored in settings\n- Error and success feedback are already handled by the existing implementation.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"nick@homeslice.ca","created_at":"2026-02-04T21:03:57.965905-05:00","created_by":"Nick Seward","updated_at":"2026-02-04T21:20:41.482146-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-04T21:20:41.482146-05:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
{"id":"vibedj-gjo","title":"Song Selection Highlighting","description":"When a user selects a song in the search results, the song should be highlighted in the search results.
